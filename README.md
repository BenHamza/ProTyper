# TypeIt #5


_Simply be the best at typing_

---


With TypeIt you will be able to automatically press on keys and simulate a real user. It is primarily designed for "Type skill" programs. Yet it is useful for other things as well.
For example open this link [Ratatype](http://www.ratatype.com/), copy paste the text onto TypeIt UI, then press F12 and see magic happen :D

Currently it is under active development. I'll update the wiki later.
